## Hey, I'm Josh! ðŸ‘‹

### >> I'm actively seeking a position in software engineering!

California State University, Monterey Bay class of '24 ðŸŒŠðŸ¦¦.

Feel free to poke around my GitHub profile to see some of my college schoolwork, hobby projects, and other software that I'm exceptionally proud of.

I also have a work-in-progress website at https://jkl2k2.github.io/ that you can check out while I continue to learn React.
